# HUB75nano
This Arduino library adds the basic functionality needed to drive a HUB 75 protocol LED Panel up to 64x32 Pixels RGB.
it can display colors up to 1/2 refresh rate pwm colors, or a 1 bit rgb buffer.

# Examples
This library also contains some examples on how to use it. The examples all end with *.ino. The COlor example focuses on how to fill the screen with a color, and also with special colors. 
The buffer examples demonstrates how to interact with the 1bit rgb buffer for the display, in order to show more precise images. It also uses the bundled pixel class to display a smiley face.
